# Doctothorpem
An open source version of Daytum from **THE FUTURE**! A future which isn't at all the present that we currently live in and selfishly expect to support our meager existence. Bottom-line: this thing isn't yet functional, has no tests, and no clear-cut goals besides:

* Solid API
* Clients for many platforms
* Easy deployablity for private installations
* Data portability

The developers of Daytum have been hired by Facebook and updates to the iPhone app seem to have stalled, leaving it broken for many people. A solid API will allow developers to build their own mobile apps and keep them updated as needed. They could even build apps that are custom to a specific type of data collection, like counting push ups by tapping your phone with your nose every time you get to the bottom of a pushup. You know, things like that.

We're running this puppy with Sinatra, Grape, Warden, Mongo (and Mongoid), and some other treats.
